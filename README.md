# CITMAGA
## Description
CITMAGA internship files. The internship consists in the implementation of a HHL algorithm that can run on an Universal Quantum Computer.

## How to use
- Install the requirements:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Then you can use the notebooks

## Description of the notebooks

- **Pruebas_Qiskit.ipynb:** This notebook contains the different tests that are being done, and don't work/don't deserve an individual file
- **Number_of_gates.ipynb:** This notebook cointains the study of the number of gates of the HHL custom circuit depending of the way it is constructed (with/without approximations)
- **Qmio_hhl.ipynb:** Notebook where the different functions are created especifically for the Qmio
- **b_side_approx.ipynb:** This notebook contains all the code related with the approximation of the right-hand side
