# CITMAGA
## Description
CITMAGA internship files. The internship consists in the implementation of a HHL algorithm that can run on an Universal Quantum Computer.

## How to use
- Create a virtual or conda environment (Optional but highly recomended)
  ```
  python -m venv qiskit
  ```
  - Run the enviroment
    ```
    qiskit\Scripts\activate
    ```

- Install the requirements:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Use the notebooks

## Description of the notebooks

- **Pruebas_Qiskit.ipynb:** This notebook contains the different tests that are being done, and don't work/don't deserve an individual file.

- **Number_of_gates.ipynb:** This notebook cointains the study of the number of gates of the HHL custom circuit depending of the way it is constructed (with/without approximations).

- **Qmio_hhl.ipynb:** Notebook where the different functions are created especifically for the Qmio.

- **b_side_approx.ipynb:** This notebook contains all the code related with the approximation of the right-hand side.

- **Qulacs.ipynb:** Contains the functions to transform the Qiskit circuit into a Qulacs circuit, and some time comparisons.

The HHL algorithm is mainly based in the HHL existent in Qiskit 0.21, with some modifications and added features based on [2].
